## Architecture Overview

Finella follows a **modular, feature-based architecture**, where each primary domain (Auth, Notes, Todos, BalanceEntries, Tools, Workplaces) lives in its own folder with all related components, hooks, and styles. This promotes clear separation of concerns, scalability, and easier maintainability.

1. **Build & Bundling**: Vite powers fast development server and optimized production builds.
2. **UI Layer**: MUI (Material UI) components themed centrally for consistent look and feel.
3. **Feature Modules**: Each feature directory contains its own React components, Redux slices, TypeScript types, and styles, enabling isolated development and testing.
4. **State Management**: Redux Toolkit organizes global state with slice-level logic and actions for each feature.
5. **Real-Time Layer**: Socket.IO client connects to backend, authenticating via JWT during handshake and listening for automation events to dispatch Redux actions.
6. **Routing**: React Router handles navigation, with protected routes guarded by auth status and role.
7. **Date/Time Handling**: Luxon provides parsing, formatting, and timezone management throughout the app.
8. **Data Exports**:

   - **PDF Reports**: `@react-pdf/renderer` transforms React components into downloadable PDF documents.
   - **Excel Workbooks**: `exceljs` generates styled spreadsheets for financial data.

## Authentication & Security

Finella implements robust security measures:

- **JWT-Based Auth**: Stateless JSON Web Tokens authenticate REST and WebSocket connections.
- **Email Verification**: Users must confirm their email before accessing the app.
- **Account Lockout**: 3 invalid login attempts lock the account for 24 hours; an email reset link can unlock early.
- **Password Reset**: Secure, tokenized link delivered via email.
- **Protected Routes**: React Router guards client-side routes; backend middleware verifies JWTs on every request.
